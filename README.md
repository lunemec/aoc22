# Advent of Code 2022 in Rust

Meant as an excercise to get to know Rust better, and see how things can/should be done in idiomatic way. Hopefully.

Puzzles are ordered as `puzzle_{DAY}_{NUM}.rs`. 

Only the last one is called from main.rs with the input data copy & pasted from AoC Website, there was no need to fetch via HTTP yet.
